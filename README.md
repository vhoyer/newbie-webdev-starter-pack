Newbie Webdev Starter Pack
==========================

Welcome to Newbie Webdev Starter Pack, NWSP for short.

Getting started
---------------

To start, clone the project, enter the folder, run npm install and start the dev server
and start coding at `src`!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vhoyer/newbie-webdev-starter-pack
cd newbie-webdev-starter-pack
npm install
npm run dev
```

Also, I recommend you delete the `.git` folder that came with this template for you to
start fresh your project. To do so, just run the following:

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git add -A
git commit -m ":tada: Initial commit"
```

All set to right modern JavaScript projects! Just start coding!
